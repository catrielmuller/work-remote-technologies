export default {
  AWS: `One third of postings mention AWS. That's ten times more than Google Cloud or Azure. If you want to make yourself marketable, learn AWS. It'll take you a while to learn, but on the way you'll learn a lot about how the web works. If you are new to this, I recommend starting out by setting up a virtual server and playing around.`,
  CSS: `If a quarter of all programming jobs on We Work Remotely mention CSS, this means that a lot of jobs require front end abilities. If you haven't touched CSS in years, learn flexbox and SCSS. Those two combined make things much nicer that they used to be.`,
  Docker: `Containerization is in an interesting place. A lot of companies are still using regular VMs for local development and production. However, those who have switched over to containers generally agree they love it. Interestingly, with Docker being used for local development, I've seen postings for Front-end Engineers that list Docker as a requirement. It might be a technology that everyone needs to learn, like git.`,
  Go: `I have no idea how popular Go actually is, cause it's hard to regex. I think it's probably more popular than listed here. As I learn more DevOps, I'm going to have to decide between Go and Python, and I think Go will win.`,
  HTML: `One in five jobs mention HTML. You can learn the basics in an hour. It would take a lot longer to even scratch the surface of all that HTML 5 allows.`,
  Java: `I've never written a line of Java. I don't know anyone who writes Java. But, I do know that Java is the enterprise work horse. Over 10% of jobs list Java, and I'm sure it would be much higher on non-remote job boards.`,
  JavaScript: `No surprise to see JavaScript topping the list. JavaScript was once called the "Lingua Franca of the Web", but today it is the "Lingua Franca of Programming". It runs in the browser, on the server, in "the cloud", and nearly everywhere else we write code. Functional, procedural, declarative, imperative, object oriented, event oriented...   If you don't know modern JavaScript, you're only hurting yourself.`,
  Laravel: `Laravel is the best thing to happen to PHP in years. But... it doesn't seem to be that popular on We Work Remotely. Too bad, because it's pretty great.`,
  Node: `A quarter of all jobs mention node. It's not a technology that can be ignored anymore. It's used on the front end for build tools, and on the back end for build tools and applications. Some people even use it in place of Python for scripting. Getting better at Node helps you get better at JavaScript, too.`,
  Python: `Python still seems like a good bet. Seeing how a fifth of jobs mention Python, and fewer than one in ten mention Django, I think it's safe to say that Python is being used for more than web development. It seems to be the glue language in DevOps.`,
  PHP: `It's easy to hate on PHP. I do it all the time. PHP 7 is an OK language, but it's not nearly as nice as Ruby or TypeScript. Still, it's in demand. But PHP is less popular on We Work Remotely than JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. That's interesting. I would have though it would be near the top.`,
  React: `React is winning the front-end framework wars. (Yes, React is a library, yes, I know.) It's more popular than Angular and Vue combined. The community is huge. If you are looking for a remote programming job, React helps. Luckily, it's not hard to learn and it's gained enough popularity that it'll be in demand for years.`,
  Ruby: `A quarter of all jobs mention Ruby. That's a little more than Python and significantly more than PHP. Perhaps interest in Ruby in on the decline, but it's still used heavily. If you haven't tried it, I recommend it. It'll make you rethink the rules of programming.`,
  "Ruby on Rails": `I was told that Ruby on Rails was dead. That doesn't seem to be the case. Roughly a quarter of companies hiring on We Work Remotely are using it - more than Express, Django and Laravel combined! If you want to learn an MVC framework, this might be the one to learn.`,
  Rust: `Rust is gaining momentum. It's a systems language users seem to love. I don't have a use case for Rust, but I wish I did because it looks fun to write.`,
  Scala: `I'm shocked to see Scala so high. I've heard only great things about it, but I don't know any Scala developers. I don't think I'll learn it until I have a use case for it, but it's good to know it's in demand.`,
  SQL: `It's been said that time spent getting good at SQL is never wasted. This seems to be true. Over 40 years after its release, SQL is everywhere that databases are. The basics are easy, but advanced SQL skills are rare.`,
  Vue: `Vue had a lot of hype for a while (it's older than you think), but it's now clearly a popular front-end framework. For many it's the sweet spot between Angular (convention/templates) and React (do what you want/it's all JS). The Vue community also seems extremely positive.`,
  Web: `Although this category is for all "programming" jobs, over 50% of the jobs included web in the job posting. Maybe this means We Work Remotely is web focused. Maybe it means that remote jobs are mostly web. I don't know. But understanding how the modern web works (HTML 5, ESNext, etc...) is in demand for all programmers.`,
