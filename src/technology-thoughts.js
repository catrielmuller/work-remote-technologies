  JavaScript: `No surprise to see JavaScript topping the list. JavaScript was once called the "Lingua Franca of the Web", but today it is the "Lingua Franca of Programming". It runs in the browser, on the server, in "the cloud", and nearly everywhere else we write code. Functional, procedural, declarative, imperative, object oriented, event oriented...   If you don't know modern JavaScript, you're only hurting yourself.`,
  Web:
    'Although this category is for all "programming" jobs, over 50% of the jobs included web in the job posting. Understanding how the modern web works (HTML 5, ESNext, etc...) is in demand for all programmers.',
  React: `React is winning the front-end framework wars. (Yes, React is framework.) It's more popular than Angular and Vue combined. The community is huge. If you are looking for a remote programming job, React helps. Luckily, it's not hard to learn.`,
  AWS: `One third of postings mention AWS. That's ten times more than Google Cloud or Azure. If you want to make yourself marketable, learn AWS. It'll take you a while. Get started now.`,
  SQL: `It's been said that time spent getting good at SQL is never wasted. This seems to be true. Over 40 years after its release, SQL is everywhere that databases are. The basics are easy. The rest takes a while.`,
  "Ruby on Rails": `I've been told that Ruby on Rails is dead. That doesn't seem to be the case. Roughly a quarter of companies are using it - more than Express, Django and Laravel combined! If you want to learn an MVC framework, this might be the one to learn.`,
  CSS: `If a quarter of all programming jobs mention CSS, this means that a lot of jobs require front end abilities. If you are back end only, it doesn't hurt to work on your front end skills.`,
  Node: `A quarter of all jobs mention node. It's not a technically you should ignore. It's used on the front end for build tools, and on the back end for build tools and applcations. Some people even use it in place of Python for scripting.`,
  Ruby: `Almost a quarter of all jobs mention Ruby. That's a little more than Python and significantly more than PHP. Perhaps interest in Ruby in on the decline, but it's still used heavily. If you haven't tried it, I recommend it. It'll make you rethink the rules of programming.`,
  Python: `I've never learned Python, but it looks like I should. Seeing how a fifth of jobs mention Python, and fewer than 1 in ten mention Django, I think it's safe to say that Python is being used for more than web development.`, HTML: `One in five jobs mention HTML. You can learn the basics in an hour. It would take a lot longer to even scratch the surface of all that HTML 5 allows.`
