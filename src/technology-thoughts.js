  JavaScript: `No surprise to see JavaScript topping the list. JavaScript was once called the "Lingua Franca of the Web", but today it is the "Lingua Franca of Programming". It runs in the browser, on the server, in "the cloud", and nearly everywhere else we write code. Functional, procedural, declarative, imperative, object oriented, event oriented...   If you don't know modern JavaScript, you're only hurting yourself.`,
  Web:
    'Although this category is for all "programming" jobs, over 50% of the jobs included web in the job posting. Understanding how the modern web works (HTML 5, ESNext, etc...) is in demand for all programmers.',
  React: `React is winning the front-end framework wars. (Yes, React is framework.) It's more popular than Angular and Vue combined. The community is huge. If you are looking for a remote programming job, React helps. Luckily, it's not hard to learn.`,
  AWS: `One third of postings mention AWS. That's ten times more than Google Cloud or Azure. If you want to make yourself marketable, learn AWS. It'll take you a while. Get started now.`,
  SQL: `It's been said that time spent getting good at SQL is never wasted. This seems to be true. Over 40 years after its release, SQL is everywhere that databases are. The basics are easy. The rest takes a while.`,
  "Ruby on Rails": `I've been told that Ruby on Rails is dead. That doesn't seem to be the case. Roughly a quarter of companies are using it - more than Express, Django and Laravel combined! If you want to learn an MVC framework, this might be the one to learn.`
